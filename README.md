# Data_Visualization_REU

# About this project

In this project, I worked on a “Data visualization” project at Rutgers University as a Summer intern in 2020. As an intern, I helped my mentor to develop a code in python to extract data from the 3 D ocean model. I created the model domain and plotted graphs to visualize the transport of the snails’ larvae from Cape Haters to the New Jersey shelf area from the year (2010 -2015) at (6,8,10) ºC spawning temperature.
